          Container queries, how you excite
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us web developers day and night.
          <br />
          No more hard-coded, fixed breakpoints.
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we can target containers, rejoice!
        </p>
        <p>
          Design systems will be much more fluid
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as we adjust for each container’s width.
          <br />
          Our layouts will adapt seamlessly
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to screens of all shapes and sizes, endlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll use flexbox and grid with ease
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to craft designs that flow like the breeze,
          <br />
          containers will respond like magic
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the content that we craft so fantastic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gone are the days of media queries galore
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that often left us with an eyesore.
          <br />
          Now we can style with precision and glee.
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Container queries, you set us free.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our designs will be more accessible,
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and layouts more intelligible.
          <br />
          We’ll focus on the content, not the screen
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thanks to container queries, our new regime.
        </p>
        <p>
          No more workarounds, no more strife.
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Container queries will change our life.
          <br />
          Our code will be cleaner and more refined
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as we build layouts that are truly divine.
        </p>
        <p>
          So let’s celebrate this paradigm shift
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and make container queries our go-to gift
          <br />
          for building responsive websites with grace
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ensuring the user experience we embrace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you, container queries, for your charm
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for keeping us from any harm.
          <br />
          As we craft the web with beauty and flair,
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we’ll know that you will always be there.
